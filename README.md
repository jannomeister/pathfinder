## Pathfinder

**Note: This project is still work in progress**

I made this project so that I can learn more about different kinds of pathfinding algorithms. Check the [online demo](https://jannomeister.github.io/pathfinder/)

## Available Algorithms

1. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: [more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)
2. **A * Search Algorithm**: [more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)
3. **Breadth-first Search**: [more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)

## Pathfinding Info

**Pathfinding** or **pathing** is the plotting, by a computer application, of the shortest route between two points. It is a more practical variant on solving mazes. This field of research is based heavily on Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path on a weighted graph.

Pathfinding is closely related to the shortest path problem, within graph theory, which examines how to identify the path that best meets some criteria (shortest, cheapest, fastest, etc) between two points in a large network.
