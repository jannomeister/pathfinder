## Pathfinder

![Vercel Status](https://therealsujitk-vercel-badge.vercel.app/?app=vercel.com/jannomeister/pathfinder)

I made this project so that I can learn more about different kinds of pathfinding algorithms. Check the [online demo](https://jannomeister.github.io/pathfinder/)

## Available Algorithms

1. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: [more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)
2. **A \* Search Algorithm**: [more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)
3. **Breadth-first Search**: [more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)

## Why A\* search is the best

A-star (also referred to as A\*) is one of the most successful search algorithms to find the shortest path between nodes or graphs. ... When a search algorithm has the property of optimality , it means it is guaranteed to find the best possible solution .

#### Supported Heuristics

- **Manhattan (default)**: [more info](http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/Heuristics.html#manhattan-distance)
- **Diagonal Chebyshev**: [more info](http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/Heuristics.html#diagonal-distance)
- **Diagonal Octile**: [more info](http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/Heuristics.html#diagonal-distance)
- **Euclidean**: [more info](http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/Heuristics.html#euclidean-distance)
- **Euclidean Squared**: [more info](http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/Heuristics.html#euclidean-distance-squared)

## Pathfinding Info

**Pathfinding** or **pathing** is the plotting, by a computer application, of the shortest route between two points. It is a more practical variant on solving mazes. This field of research is based heavily on Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path on a weighted graph.

Pathfinding is closely related to the shortest path problem, within graph theory, which examines how to identify the path that best meets some criteria (shortest, cheapest, fastest, etc) between two points in a large network.
